# Live-Coding Toolkit
<!-- Plugin description -->
This plugin helps people write code faster for presentations, demos or discussions accompanied by code.

### Tricks to optimize typing
- Quick fix to define a constructor injecting final fields with @RequiredArgsConstructor (lombok) instead of the existing one or to fix compilation.
- If an undefined "log" is used in code, it suggests adding to the class a sfl4j Logger log field or the @Slf4j annotation (lombok)
- Defines an action to silently auto-import static selected methods and constants. The action is bound by default
  to Ctrl-Shift-O, but the shortcut is editable. The list of static tokens is editable via settings, but a large number
  of commonly used ones are predefined, such as:
  Collectors.toList, Assertions.assertThat, Mockito.mock/when/verify, Collectors.toList/toSet, Duration.*
- Detects dangerous code generated by Lombok in a JPA @Entity and suggests fixes: replace @Data with @Getter @Setter and @ToString
- Menu entry under Git> to quickly copy the git coordinates (remote + branch to clipboard)

### Reason 
I created this plugin to optimize the live coding that I do during my training sessions and presentations. More about me : https://www.victorrentea.ro

Next features:
- lower the @RAC replace hint to only fix unless you are in a @Component, or another annotation annotated with @Component
- [wow!] anonymize a method by replacing names with other names and creating the necessary stubbing. Maybe also detecting complex methods to select.
- if some fields are already assigned in constructor, make sure AddRequiredArgsConstructor deletes the boilerplate ctor.
- detect local calls of spring aspected annotations
- TODO: declare new local for params
- Split Variable
  if (employees.size() != 0) {
    averageConsultantSalary /= employees.size();
  }
  for () v = v + 1;  NO
  v = 73;
  try {v += 44;}
- var fara init, folosita in blocuri disjuncte: = apoi ref. !! dupa sa nu existe ref
- var cu init, folosita in blocuri disjuncte
- DREAM: "analyze parameter mutation"
