# Live-Coding Toolkit

This plugin will help people write code faster for presentations, demos or discussions.

Currently, various ways to refactor to Lombok are implemented:
- Detect and offer to replace a constructor for final fields with @RequiredArgsConstructor
- When final fields are not set, offer to annotate the class with @RequiredArgsConstructor
- If a "log" is used anywhere in code, it offers to annotate the class with @Slf4j
