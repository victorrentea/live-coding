# Live-Coding IntelliJ IDEA Plugin
<!-- Plugin description -->
This plugin aims to help people write code faster for presentations, demos or discussions accompanied by code. Like I do every single week.

More about me : https://www.victorrentea.ro

### Features
- Add `@RequiredArgsConstructor` (lombok) either when `private final` fields are not initialized or to replace the constructor (especially in a Spring-managed bean).
- QuickFix to define a `log` Slf4j logger, on any undefined `log` token, either by adding a `@Slf4j` (lombok) or declaring a standard Sfl4j `Logger log` field on the class
- Action to silently auto-import usual static methods and constants. The action _Auto-import statics_ is bound by default
  to `Ctrl-Shift-O`, but the shortcut is editable. The list of static tokens is editable via settings, but many commonly used ones are predefined, such as: 
  Collectors.toList, Assertions.assertThat, Mockito.mock/when/verify, Collectors.toList/toSet, Duration.*
- Detects dangerous code generated by Lombok in a JPA `@Entity` and suggests fixes: For example replace `@Data` with `@Getter` `@Setter` and careful `@ToString`
- Menu entry under Git> to quickly copy the git coordinates (remote + branch to clipboard)
- Inspection to remove `final` from variables and params (for those not liking them)
- **Declare new variable here** inspection and fix for local variables ~recycled~ reused in the same method

## Declare new variable here
Purpose: many times in legacy code a variable is declared, assigned and used with a certain meaning, but later on it is reassigned to a different value. 
IntelliJ already highlights reassigned variables by underlining them to hint it's a bad idea to reassign local variables. 
Immutable local variables are a default in many other modern languages like Kotlin, Scala, Closure.
This inspection attempts to promote using variables for a single purpose, 
by proposing a fix to declare a new variable (with another name) whenever that's possible. 
In other words, enabling easier application of the **Split Variable** Refactoring from the classic refactoring moves.

Some cases are trivial, like for example `LinearRedefinition.java`, others are very tricky like `LaterUsageAfterReturningBlockNestedKO` while for other syntax examples
I honestly don't know yet how and IF I want to implement this refactoring.

#### Call for help
Please help me to identify more code examples for this refactoring. 
First check out the examples in the [src/test/live-coding-playground/src/main/java/declarenewlocal](https://github.com/victorrentea/live-coding/tree/main/src/test/live-coding-playground/src/main/java/declarenewlocal)
The convention is that whenever you see a `//` on a line, the fix is suggested there.

**Question is: did I miss any interesting case?**

Please help.
Thank you!

PS: you could also install the "Live-coding Toolkit" plugin if you want to test the feature on your code.

**Note**: After it stabilizes, I plan to contribute this quickfix to IntelliJ IDEA Community to make it available for all Java developers out there. 

## Next features:
- Add more moods (zen, boring, horror) : childplay image from code smells
- **Split Declaration** to push declaration down in exclusive branches 
- Detect "-> {" containing more than one return statement and suggest extracting a method
- Detect consecutive IF on exclusive == , suggest adding an "else"
- Suggest avoiding "default ->" in switch expressions on enums (to allow the compiler to check all branches)
- [wow!] anonymize a method by replacing names with other names and creating the necessary stubbing. Maybe also detecting complex methods to select.
- Detect local calls to methods annotated with proxying annotations, like Spring: @Transactional, @Cacheable, @PreAuthorized, ... 
- [?] Report "Exception can be made Runtime": if no one in caller's stack catches the checked exception individually + checked exception traverses at least 2 methods
- **Big Dreams: "analyze parameter mutation" inspection** to report what fields of parameters change at call site (analysis upon request)
- PR to Presentation Asssitant : checkbox: only show refactoring shortcuts used.
