<p>Highlights places in which Lombok generates dangerous code for a JPA/Hibernate <code>@Entity</code></p>
<p>Including all fields in a generated <code>toString</code> implementation can
    trigger lazy-loading collections of children leading to runtime exceptions or (worse) degraded performance caused by
    (sometime useless) network traffic and memory churn. @ToString.Exclude will be added to all collection fields, unless they were already marked with @ToString.Include</p>
<p>Implementing <code>hashCode</code> and <code>equals</code> on <b>all</b> fields of an <code>@Entity</code> is
    generally discouraged,
    as the ORM assigns the @Id and other fields at .persist() time. This will cause the hashCode to return a different
    value, which may lead to unexpected behavior when adding your instances of your Entities of a HashSet or as keys in
    a HashMap.
</p>
<p>Lastly, from a design point of view, opening all fields to read/write from outside breaks encapsulation of your
    Domain Entity, and promotes an <b>Anemic</b> Domain Model. In general, it is advisable to only provide
    setters for those fields that can freely be changed from outside. In short, the decision to break encapsulation
    should be made with greater care in most projects.</p>
